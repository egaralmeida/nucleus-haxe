/*

- Build a portal and ships from your planet will start arriving under certain conditions
-- A builder ship, an "imp" ship, fighters, etc.
-- Imp ships can reinforce walls, maybe dig under footprints, etc.

- Enemies who patrol the layers find openings to follow.

- Is there gravity? If not, what about a gravity generator you can place. You get one to start with, then you get upgrades / more available. 
-- They could be used to pick things up, otherwise they fly away. 
-- The ship can have a gravity field the player can activate and deactivate (or maybe also invert?). Maybe the field can be detached and left floating as well, and reattached when needed.


---- Building ----

- Building structures achieved by making the footprint, and builder ships follow it. 
-- Manual building could be done as well.

- Molecular printer: A builder menu consisting of a grid with which to build things. The grid can grow in size, starting from a low space grid (like 5x5?) to build basic drones, reaching
bigger sizes to build structures.
